# About Agility

## Introduction

Agility is a pioneering financial service designed to revolutionize the security and efficiency of digital transactions. Recognizing the vulnerabilities inherent in conventional Web2 payment systems, Agility leverages the power of the XRP Ledger, Interledger Protocol, Web3 domains, and Midnight's Zero Knowledge Proof system to create a new paradigm for secure, private, and user-friendly transactions.

## History

Conceived in 2022 during Ripple's inaugural "real-life use cases" hackathon, Agility initially focused on enabling small businesses to accept XRPL tokens as payments similar to PayPal for business and ecommerce stores. We created a working prototype as an App and eventually one of Agility's developers, with the help of the XRdoge decentralized community (founders bags burned) created a hardware device to accompany the software.

However, the project quickly evolved to address the pressing need for heightened security and data privacy within the Web3 landscape. The team of Agility decided to each go and learn different aspects of the challenges we were facing. Funding issues and legal clarity continued to stifle the actual product advancement, so becoming educated was vital while the tech caught up.

## Vision

Through strategic collaborations and technological innovation, Agility is building a robust platform that transcends the limitations of traditional payment gateways. A cornerstone of Agility's development is the integration with Midnight's cutting-edge privacy protocols. By harnessing Zero Knowledge Proofs, Agility ensures that sensitive user data remains confidential even during transaction validation, setting a new standard for privacy in the digital economy.
